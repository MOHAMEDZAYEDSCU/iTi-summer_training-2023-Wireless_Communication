** wireless communicaton:

- collect
- communicate
- analyze 
- act

** sensing and network layers
- sensors --> detect input from physical environment

* Tags:

- passive --> no power source, when be near to the reader it givethe tag power to be on.
- active --> with power source.
- semi-passive --> 

** IOT systems must be efficient in:
- power consumption --> less as could.
- range --> largest as possible.
- bandwidth --> the channel of data (width of the channal).

** Network layer:

- high power - high range - high band width --> cellular and satellite. -- Lte, 5G(based on M2M).
- high power - low range - high band width --> wifi , bluetooth 
- low - high - low --> LPWAN (low power wide area network) like LoRaWAN.
- low - low - low --> RFID , NFC

** block diagram:

- ADC --> more accurate, flexibility, noise immunity.
- sourcing incoding -->
-Modulation --> 

* analog signal --> continous -- affected by noises.
* digital signal --> descrite -- (0,1) -- not affected by noises -- more accurate.

-- samples frequences with double the frequence -- nyquist rate (Any frequence else making ilyasing).

** modulation:
- modifying the signal to be transmitted (get help from high signal (carrier signal)).
 
** can be modified by (modulation):

- amplitiude --> alot of problems -- signal on when 1 and off while 0. 
- frequence --> 
- phase --> binary phase shift king -- 2 psk (00) in a simpole -- **circule and depend on the angle and phase** -- there is (8 psk) 3 bits(000) -- (16 psk) by 4 bits(0000)

- in the air the signal will be sent analog.
- 64 QAM (amplitiude and phase) -- 6 bit by simpole.
