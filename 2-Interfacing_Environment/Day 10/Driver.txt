Drivers:

drivers are .h and .c files e.g. (DIO.c, DIO.h) to be ready to get included in any project.

dio.h contains

1. a function to initialize all the pins to either inputs or outputs.
2. a function to read the channel's input, the function takes the port name.
2. a function to write the channels to output, the function takes the port name and the state to write.

The dio layer is called Micro controller abstraction layer (MCAL).

dio is microcontroller dependant.

Layers:

1. Application				(APP)		Calculator
2. Hardware Abstraction Layer 		(HAL)		Keypad, LCD
3. Micro Controller Abstraction layer 	(MCAL)		DIO, SPI



TASK:

Write the following functions

1. DIO_init(uint8);	<-- uint8 will be directly stored in DDRD
2. DIO_WriteChannel(PORTA1, 0);
3. DIO_ReadChannel(PORTA1);
