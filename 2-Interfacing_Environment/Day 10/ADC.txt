Analog vs Digital

Analog value is value with no certain step e.g. (the analog values between 0 and 5 are infinite)

The digital value is value with a certain step e.g. (the digital values between 0 and 5 is dependent on the step)

ADC convert the analog values to digital values.

ADC is known by it's bit numbers.
10-bit ADC output 10 bits.		basically divide the analog values into 10 bits.

V(ref)	is the number which the ADC bits will all turn to 1's

the step = V(ref) / 2 ^ (bits of ADC)
