# Summer Training on Internet of Things - Wireless Communication

## C Programming
In the initial part of the training, we delved into C programming. We covered the following topics:
- Syntax of C
- If / else statements
- Memory allocation
- Pointers
- Function pointers

## Embedded Systems Interface
The training then shifted towards embedded systems and interface development. Topics included:
- Layer-based programming, covering MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) and Application Layer
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) drivers
- DIO (Digital Input/Output) drivers

## Linux and Ubuntu
As a part of broadening our skill set, we also delved into Linux and its commands, with a particular focus on Ubuntu.

## Wireless Communication Methods
We explored various wireless communication methods, including:
- QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)
- QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)

## LoRaWAN
The culmination of the training involved a deep dive into LoRaWAN and how to program it for IoT applications.

This README.md serves as a brief overview of my summer training journey.
